                <p>At Chick-fil-a, I worked as a FOH (front of house) team member!
                    I would take orders on their POS system, or take orders out to their cars!
                    Every night I would help clean the the dining room and behind the cash registers.

                <p>At IHOP, I was in charge of putting together, and bagging up all the to-go order, no matter

                <p>At Let's Meat KBBQ, I had two objectives to choose from, one of them was running raw foods, on a
                    tray, from the kitchen to
                    the customer's table, or cleaning the table after a customer left. It alternated everday!

                <p>At Bob Evan's, I started off as a host and slowly transitioned to a
                    afternoon server. After I left and came back, I was promoted to shift leader
                    and was in charge of running the restaurant. Because of this, I had to learn every position there,
                    this
                    included: Dishwasher, Cook, Cashier, Server, & Host.
